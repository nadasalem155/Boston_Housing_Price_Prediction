# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston using various housing and demographic features such as number of rooms, crime rate, and distance to employment centers.

## Dataset
- *Source:* [Boston Housing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices) — a classic dataset widely used in regression problems.
- *Target Variable:* MEDV – Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Dropped weakly correlated features (CHAS, B).
- Verified no missing values or duplicate rows.
- Detected and removed outliers using the IQR method.
- Applied Min-Max scaling to numerical features for normalization.

## Models Applied & Performance

| Model                     | Features Used                  | Reason for Selection                          | MSE   |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| Simple Linear Regression  | RM                             | Strongest positive correlation with MEDV      | 28.92 |
| Multiple Linear Regression| RM, PTRATIO, LSTAT             | Top 3 most correlated features                | 13.82 |
| Polynomial Regression     | RM, PTRATIO, LSTAT             | Capture non-linear relationships              | *9.29* |

*Evaluation Metric:* Mean Squared Error (MSE) — Lower values indicate better performance.

## Dataset Features

| Column   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| CRIM     | Per capita crime rate by town |
| ZN       | Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots |
| INDUS    | Proportion of non-retail business acres |
| CHAS     | Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river) |
| NOX      | Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million) |
| RM       | Average number of rooms per dwelling |
| AGE      | % of owner-occupied units built before 1940 |
| DIS      | Weighted distance to employment centers |
| RAD      | Accessibility to radial highways |
| TAX      | Property tax rate per $10,000 |
| PTRATIO  | Pupil-teacher ratio by town |
| B        | 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 (Bk = % Black population) |
| LSTAT    | % lower status of the population |
| MEDV     | Median value of owner-occupied homes (Target) |


## Conclusion

Among the three applied models, Polynomial Regression achieved the lowest MSE and provided the most accurate predictions. This suggests that the relationship between housing features and prices is not strictly linear and benefits from more complex, non-linear modeling.

💡 *Note:* MEDV represents the *median* (not mean) value of home prices, which is more robust in the presence of outliers.
